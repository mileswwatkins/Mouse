## A note about safety

The backcountry can be dangerous, and Mouse is _not_ a safety tool. You shouldn't depend on Mouse's information when making decisions, especially regarding hazardous weather or wildfires.

## How do I get access to Mouse?

Mouse is currently in beta, so you'll need to ask the developer (Miles Watkins) for Mouse's phone number. Once you have that phone number, you can text it from your Garmin InReach or other SMS-capable device.

Please only use Mouse on your satellite communication device if you pay for a plan with unlimited text messages! Mouse's responses can be long (ie, multiple messages) and quickly eat up your plan otherwise.

## What can I ask Mouse?

### Weather forecasts

_The user must be using a Garmin InReach with location sharing turned on, in which case there will be an `inreachlink.com/#######` automatically appended to each text message the user sends. This link can be used to determine your GPS location and thus fetch your weather forecast._

##### Your message

```weather```

The franchise was created by Satoshi Tajiri in 1996, and is centered on fictional creatures called "Pok√©mon". In Pok√©mon, humans, known as Pok√©mon Trainers, catch and train Pok√©mon to battle other Pok√©mon for sport. All media works within the franchise are set in the Pok√©mon universe. The English slogan for the franchise is "Gotta Catch ‚ÄòEm All!". There are currently 901 Pok√©mon species.

## Development

This project runs on the serverless architecture of Twilio Functions.

### Requirements

- Node 12
- `npm install`

And if you want to deploy instead of just running/testing locally, then also:

- A Twilio account and active phone number
- Populating a `.env` file or your shell environment with your Twilio `ACCOUNT_SID` and `AUTH_TOKEN`

### Tests

- `npm run test` runs all unit tests
- `npm run test-watch` runs a daemon that runs tests for all files that have changed since your last Git commit
- `npm run test-e2e` runs the end-to-end tests, that make actual HTTP requests

This project also uses Husky to propagate pre-commit Git hooks. Any new commit will trigger the unit tests, and commits on the `main` branch will trigger the end-to-end tests as well.

### Running locally

```sh
npm run start
```

Then, you should be able to make HTTP POST requests to `http://localhost:3000/mouse`, making sure to include your desired message in the `Body` property of your POST data, eg:

```sh
curl http://localhost:3000/mouse \
    --request POST \
    --data '{"Body":"closures pct"}' \
    --header "Content-Type: application/json"

<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?><Response><Message>Closures by region: Southern California 5, Central California 0, Northern California 5, Oregon 1, Washington 3</Message><Message>To get a list of all closures in a region, include that region's name in your text (eg, text `closures central california`)</Message></Response>%
```

### Deploying

- `npm run deploy`, which will (assuming success) print `Deployment Details`, which includes Mouse's Twilio Function's URL (eg `https://mouse-1234-dev.twil.io/mouse`)
- In the Twilio web console, navigate to your phone number, scroll down to the `Messaging` section, and in the `A MESSAGE COMES IN` section set your Webhook field to Mouse's URL
  - You'll only need to edit this field once; all future `npm run deploy` commands will deploy Mouse to the same URL (since the service ID is saved in a gitignore'd `.twiliodeployinfo` file)
